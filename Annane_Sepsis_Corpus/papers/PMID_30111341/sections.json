This patient-level meta-analysis based on 11 randomizedtrials investigates theimpact ofprocalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy on mortality inintensivecare unit(ICU)patients withinfection, both overall and stratified according to sepsis definition, severity, and typeof infection.

    "Conclusion": "Results:Mortality in the 2252 procalcitonin-guided patients was significantly lower compared with the 2230 control group patients (21.1% vs 23.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 0.99; p=0.03). These effects on mortality persisted in a subgroup of patients meeting the sepsis 3 definition and based on the severity of sepsis (assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, occurrence of septic shock or renal failure, and need for vasopressor or ventilatory support) and on the type of infection (respiratory, urinary tract, abdominal, skin, or central nervous system), with interaction for each analysis being >0.05. Procalcitonin guidance also facilitated earlier discontinuation of antibiotics, with a reduction in treatment duration (9.3 vs 10.4 days; adjusted coefficient−1.19 days, 95% CI −1.73 to −0.66; p< 0.001).
