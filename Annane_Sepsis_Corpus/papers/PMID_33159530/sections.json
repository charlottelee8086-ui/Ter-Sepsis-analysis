Minimization of volutrauma and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)",
    "Conclusion": "results in a lower incidence of barotrauma, improved oxygenation and a decrease in circulating proinflammatory markers. Recent randomized clinical trials did not reveal harmful muscular effects during a short course of NMBAs. The use of NMBAs should be considered during the early phase of severe ARDS for patients to facilitate lung protective ventilation or prone positioning only after optimising mechanical ventilation and sedation. The use of NMBAs should be integrated in a global strategy including the reduction of tidal volume, the rational use of PEEP, prone positioning and the use of a ventilatory mode allowing spontaneous ventilation as soon as possible. Partial neuromuscular blockade should be evaluated in future trials.

When vigorous spontaneous effort is preserved during mechanical ventilation, transpulmonary pressure (Paw—Ppl PL) reaches injuriously high, thereby increasing tidal volume and causing global overdistension. = In addition, negative Ppl distends pulmonary capillary vessels and increases perfusion; the transmural pressure across pulmonary capillary vessels is increased (Pcap—Ppl 30), promoting interstitial edema formation (right magnified panel). In the presence of injury, permeability is increased =+ and, therefore, alveolar edema formation is accelerated (Right magnified panel). In ARDS, atelectasis is often present in dorsal (dependent) lung regions (dotted black area in lung). Since the presence of atelectatic ‘solid-like’ lung tissue may block the pressure transmission of negative ∆Ppl following diaphragmatic contraction, more negative ∆Ppl is localized in dorsal lung regions (negative ∆Ppl 20cmH2O vs. 10cmH2O in dorsal vs. − − ventral lung regions). In this way, greater local (dorsal) lung stress causes local overdistension by drawing gas from other lung regions—e.g., ventral lung (blue line; this is called pendelluft phenomenon [45]) or directly from a ventilator. Thus, the bulk of effort-dependent lung injury occurs in dorsal lung regions, where vigorous spontaneous effort causes greater inspiratory lung stress and stretch (three red lines in lower panel). In addition, vigorous spontaneous effort causes patient–ventilator asynchrony and derecruitment with active exhalation.
