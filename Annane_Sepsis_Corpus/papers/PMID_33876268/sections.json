    "Method": "patients with severe COVID-19 including those with COVID- related ARDS. This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. Methods: The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality.",
    "Conclusion": "Results: We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72–0.95, ARR 8.0%, 95% CI 2.2–12.5%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course. Conclusion: The use of corticosteroids probably reduces mortality in patients with ARDS. This effect was consistent between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, corticosteroid types, and dosage. Keywords: Corticosteroids, ARDS, COVID-19, Mechanical ventilation Introduction The role of corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial [1].

initiated corticosteroids late [21, 23] (e-Fig. 17), none of which substantially altered the pooled estimates or conclusions. None of our post- hoc subgroup analyses showed credible subgroup effects (e-Figs. 15, 16, 19). Corticosteroid use may reduce ICU mortality (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.99, ARR 18.6%, 95% CI 0.5–29.6% reduc- tion, low certainty, e-Fig. 8) and probably reduce hos- pital mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46–0.96, ARR 16.6%, 2.0–27.2% reduction, moderate certainty, e-Fig. 9) in critically ill patients with ARDS. The use of corticoster- oids may lead to fewer days of mechanical ventilation (MD 4.04 days fewer, 95% CI 2.53–5.53 days fewer, low certainty, e-Fig. 18) and a shorter hospital length of stay (MD 8.05 days fewer, 95% CI 3.12–12.98 days fewer, low certainty, e-Fig. 10). There was an uncertain effect on ICU length of stay with corticosteroids (MD 0.78 days more, 95% CI 4.11 days more to 5.68 days fewer, very low certainty, e-Fig. 11). There are unclear differences in rates of neuromuscular weakness (271 patients in 2 trials, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62– 1.18, e-Fig. 12) and gastrointestinal bleeding (436 patients in 5 trials, RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.43–3.34, e-Fig. 13) with cor- ticosteroids although these were all based on low or very low certainty evidence. There was probably an increase in hyperglycemia (915 patients in six trials, RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.23, moderate certainty evidence, e-Fig. 14) with corticosteroids; however, this outcome was rated down for indirectness, given the variability in definitions of hyperglycemia used across studies. Superinfections due to corticosteroid use are summarized as in e-Table 4. Since some studies individually counted multiple infec- tions in one individual as separate data points and oth- ers did not, we opted not to pool this data. Although we could not pool data for this outcome, and understanding these limitations, it did not appear as though there was any signal for increase in superinfection (221 infections in corticosteroid group, 244 infections in control group). Discussion ARDS is in part the result of an innate immune-cell mediated inflammatory response that causes damage to the alveoli of the lung in response to a direct injury [9]. It has long been hypothesized that treatment with cor- ticosteroids, as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, may benefit patients with ARDS, regardless of etiology [21, 23]. The results of our systematic review and meta-anal- ysis is the first to support this hypothesis, indicating that corticosteroids may reduce mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation in all patients with ARDS. Fur- thermore, corticosteroids likely cause few side effects, except for an increase in hyperglycemia. This effect on mortality appears to be consistent across COVID-19 )deunitnoc( 1 elbaT detcelloc semoctuo tnaveleR noitpircsed tnemtaerT ygoloitE airetirc noisulcnI rebmun latoT ,retnec-itlum sv elgnis
