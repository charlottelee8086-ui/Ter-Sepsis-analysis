This narrative review was undertaken following a PubMed search for English-language reports published before January 2023 using the terms 'acuterespiratorydistress syndrome', 'sepsis', and 'steroids'. Additional reports were identified by examining the reference lists of selected articles and based on personnel knowledge of the authors of the field. High-quality research is needed to fully understand the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS and to determine the optimal timing, dose, and duration of treatment.",
